# [Input Lag Test](https://input-lag-test.theamplifiedbananabubble.fr)

Hosted at https://input-lag-test.theamplifiedbananabubble.fr

A small utility website that allows to test the time between when you click on
                                      any button and when you actually see the result. This test is not very precise,
                                      as it depends on your accuracy.
